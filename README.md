# ABOUT ME
I’m a second year graduate student majoring in Computer Science (ALIGN Master of Computer Science).  
I received my PhD degree of Organic Chemistry in 2014 and worked for two and half years as a Postdoc 
but changed my interest into computer science field. 

I’ve taken the required ALIGN courses: Discrete and Data Structures using C, Intensive Foundations of 
Computer Science using Racket, Introductory Algorithms and Computer Systems in Fall 2016 and Spring 2017.
After those, I learnt Object Oriented Design using Java in Spring 2017, Database Management using mySQL 
in Summer I 2017 and Algorithms in Summer II 2017.
I’ll take Web Development and Machine Learning in Fall 2017 and start to look for Co-op jobs.
